# Monopoly
This simulates a game of monopoly, recording statistics on how often each square is landed on. It assumes the player has unlimited money. The dice are rolled as many times as the user specifies. 
Both HumanTime and commaNumber are dependencies, only the Monopoly.py file is intended to be run directly.
